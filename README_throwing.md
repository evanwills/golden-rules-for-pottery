## General

### __Rule 1:__ Have your seat adjusted and placed right

#### Details:

The further you are away from your pot, the more extended your arms need to be to reach your work, the further away support is from your hands and the harder it is to get control over your hands

#### Why?
You want to be comfortable and strong. If your seat is not in the right place, at the right height and tilted forward a little, you will not be able to apply the force you need to the clay during the centering process. Or have the support you need to use your hands with finesse throughout the rest of the thowing process.

#### How?
1. Have your seat placed so your elbows can firmly touch your body and your hands can move over the centre of the wheel.

2. If you've got short legs (like me), and your wheel has a fixed peddle (as most do), rotate your wheel so the peddle is closer to you. You don't want to have your leg too stretched out. Having your Ieg stretched out reduces your leg's ability to provide support for the rest of your body.

3. Adjust your seat so that the top of your seat roughly level with head of the wheel. (The larger the piece of clay the higher your seat should be.)

4. Perch on your seat. If you sit back in your seat your body weight is supported by your bum. If you perch on your seat, your legs need to ballance you. As you lean forward to put your hands on your pot (if you have your arms supported) your arms start taking the weight of your upper body providing making your arms less mobile and thus less susceptible to moving freely when they shouldn't


### __Rule 2:__ Only touch the pot when it's moving

#### Why?

If you touch the pot when it's stopped you distort it in one spot. Whereas if you touch it when it's moving the distortion is spread over a much larger area making it much less obvious and making it look intentional.
### __Rule 3:__ Everything you do needs to be a slow, gentle, fluid movement

#### Why?

Sharp movements have a similar effect as touching the pot when it's stopped.

### __Rule 4:__ Always keep both hands connected

#### Why?

When you are learning, your biggest issue is control over how your hands interact with the pot. If your hands are connected you don't have think about whether they are moving in the same way/complimentary way.

#### How?

__When centering:__ Mostly, I keep my hands so that the base of my thumbs are touching.

__When pulling up:__ I generally keep the pad or tip of the thumb of the hand I have inside the pot (my left when the wheel is moving counter-clockwise) connected to the back of the thumb on the outside of the pot.

#### Note:

There are many different ways you can have your hands touching. Exactly how is less important that the fact that they touch.

### __Rule 5:__ Always clean up the base of your pot

#### Why?

If your base is clean and round, everything else is easy! Also having a slight under-cut at the very base of your pot allows your fingers to be in a better position for pulling up.

#### How?

Scrape away the uneven clay using your right index finger tightly supported by your left hand, or a wooden (not metal) tool, held in the right hand and tightly supported by the left.

### __Rule 6:__ Always keep your hands and the pot slippery

#### Why?

If your pot is not slippery, it is sticky. This stickiness will cause stress on the walls of your pot and tend to cause unwanted/excessive twisting in the clay. This twisting invariably causes the pot to collapse.

#### How?

Each time you take your hand off the pot:

1. Dunk your sponge in your water

2. Make the wheel move moderately slowly

3. Hold your hand (unmoving) over the gently rotating rim of the pot (or the top of your mound of clay, if you haven't opened up yet)

4. As the pot/mound moves below your hand, gently squeeze the water out of the sponge so it runs down your hand and off the knuckle of your little finger onto the rim of the pot

5. Gently adjust the position of your hand so water runs onto the pot flowing down both the inside and outside

### __Rule 7:__ Get each step right before moving on

#### Details:

Don't move onto the next step unless the current step is as good as you can make it.

#### Why?

Because it makes everything harder (if not impossible).

## When centering

### __Rule 8:__ Apply your main force on the side coming towards you.
This is the time when you need to apply the most force to the clay because you need it to change from a lumpy, jarring blob to a smooth round dome.

### __Hot tip:__ Use your body to give you extra power

#### Details:

Your hands and especially your fingers are not particularly strong. (This is especially true when first learning to throw.) By using your body in the following ways, you add significantly to the force you can apply to a lumpy blob of clay (or a large fat doughnut of clay you want to bring up into a cylinder).

#### Note:

(The following applies to wheels that move counter clock-wise (western/European wheels). If your wheel rotates clock-wise (Asian wheels), just swap the hands/feet assigned.)

#### How?

##### For people who are taller than 157cm (5ft 4in):
1. Tuck your left elbow into your hip so that it is resting.

2. As you need more force, lean on your left arm. (This has the benefit of adding your body weight to the force you can apply to the clay.)

##### For people who are shorter than 157cm (5ft 4in):

1. If your arms aren't long enough, put your left foot on something (like a brick or two) to raise your thigh.

2. Tuck your left elbow into your inner thigh.

3. As you need more force, use your leg to provide extra the muscle (this gives the same effect as leaning on your arm although it lacks the benefits of using body mass).

##### For everybody:

1. Try and place your left palm at a right angle to your forearm.

2. Apply the force from your body, through your forearm and out (in a straight line) through the heal of your palm.
Only apply force using the heal of your palm. (Don't use your fingers or even the top of your palm as the flexibility in your hand allows the clay to push your hand about rather than the other way around.)

3. Always use your other hand to apply downwards pressure to stop yourself from pushing the clay off the wheel.

4. Alternate between sideways pressure and downwards pressure to work your clay

## When Pulling Up

### __Rule 9:__ Never let any water sit in the bottom of your pot

#### Why?

Clay absorbs water. When the water sits in the bottom of your pot, more water is absorbed there than anywhere else. As the clay dries out it shrinks. The bit that has the most water dries last but it still needs to shrink, even if the rest of the pot has shrunk as much as it can. This final shrink in the bottom will cause a crack.
(This type of crack is called an "S" crack because it forms an "S" shape across the centre of the bottom of your pot.)

#### How?

Use a sponge to sop up the excess water immediately after rewetting the pot.

### __Rule 10:__ Always pull up on the side that's moving away from you
If your clay gets sticky, it can cause your fingers to catch on the walls of your pot. If you pull up on the side coming towards you and your fingers stick, they will be forced into the wall of your pot. Usually this means the very sudden demise of your pot.
If your wheel is rotating counter-clock-wise (normal for western wheels/potters), work on the right hand side of the pot.
If your wheel is rotating clock-wise (normal for Asian wheels/potters), work on the left hand side of the pot.

### __Rule 11:__ Always move from the very bottom to the very top
When making a pot you are generally trying to make the pot taller. Working from the top down will greatly reduce your ability to raise your pot and will tend to make the walls much thicker than desired.
Start from the recently cleaned base of your pot and move slowly and evenly up till your hands move off the clay at the top.

## Before you take the pot off

### __Reminder:__ Always clean the base (again)
If you clean the base before you cut the pot from the wheel, it gives you an easy place to pick the pot up from and makes it cleaner for turning.
(See rule 5 for how)

### __Rule 12:__ Always clean your rim

#### Why?

If the rim is not parallel to the wheel, when you go to turn your pot, you will not be able to centre it properly and it may wobble as you're working.

#### How?

1. Make sure the pot and your fingers are nice and slippery.
 
2. Make the wheel spin at a moderate speed

3. Place your thumb and forefinger on the pot so one is inside and the outside (on the side of the pot travelling away from you).

4. Ensure the top of your thumb is just below the lowest point on the rim

5. In the other hand, hold the needle tool so that it can slide across your thumb and into the pot.

6. Ensure the needle tool is resting firmly on your thumb. (The pressure helps stabilise your movements and limit the possibility of losing control of the needle tool.)

7. Slowly and gently ide the needle tool towards your forefinger, through the wall of your pot over a number of revolutions of the wheel/pot.

8. Hopefully the ring of excess clay you've just cut off will lift up with the needle tool. If not, just stop the wheel and pick off the excess clay with the needle tool.

### __Reminder:__ Never leave any water sitting in the bottom of your pot

See rule 9 for how & why.

### __Hot tip:__ Fragile pots need some extra help

If you're not using a bat and have to lift the pot off the wheel, you often get some distortion in you pot

#### How?

1. Gently place a square of newspaper over the pot so there's an inch or so overhang in every direction.

2. Run your finger very lightly over the newspaper around the rim of your pot so the rim makes a damp ring in the newspaper. (This means the pot has stuck to the paper.)

3. Lift the pot off the wheel and place it on a board (or something)

4. Leave the newspaper where it is so it can protect the pot when it's wrapped

## After you've taken the pot off

### __Rule 13:__ Always handle your pot with care

#### Why?

Newly made pots are VERY delicate. They can be seriously damaged by rough treatment.

#### How?
Never pick the pot by the rim and always hold the pot with both hands.


### __Rule 14:__ Flip your pot over as soon as you can

#### Why?

The bulk of moisture in your pot is in the base. It is also the area that has the poorest air circulation. By placing the pot bottom up you greatly increase the area from which the moisture can evaporate. Also the moisture in your pot tends to follow the force of gravity. By making the moisture head towards the rim of your pot, you move it to an area of larger surface area by weight, thus making your pot dry more evenly.

#### How?

As soon as your pot is dry enough, flip it over!
(By "dry enough" I mean that when you touch the rim it moves a little bit but not too freely. And it's not sticky. This state is called "leather hard".
If it's a larger pot:
1. Put a bat on top (the bat must be big enough to cover the entire rim of the pot)

2. (If it's not already sitting on a bat) place the bottom on another bat

3. Hold your hands so one hand is supporting the bottom bat from below and the other hand is gently but firmly pressing down on the top bat.

4. Flip the pot over.

5. Remove the bat that is now on the top. (i.e. The one touching the base of your pot.)

### __Rule 15:__ Wrap your pot if you're not going to work on it for a couple of days

#### Why?

When you are ready to turn your pot, it needs to be leather hard (or a little harder), not bone dry. If it's bone dry when you go to turn it, it will create very fine dust which is a major health hazard to you (and those around you). It also makes the tools get very blunt very quickly. Thus greatly reducing the tool's immediate function and overall life span.
