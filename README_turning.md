## Why do we turn?

There are three main reasons why we turn our pots:

1. To work the pot in a way that we can't when throwing.
2. To make the pot look better/finished/professional.
3. To reduce the overall weight.

## __Rule 1:__ The pot should not be too wet

### Details: The pot is too wet if:

* You can deform the rim by gentle touching

* You get clay on your fingers when you touch it

* The foot can easily be smeared

(Sometimes you can only only tell once you start turning.)

### Why?
If the pot is too wet when you go to turn it will distort either in the centering process or under the pressure of the turning tools. Fortunately, this can sometimes be repaired as you can later distort the pot back to its original shape.

### Note:
By _smeared_, I mean if you put your finger to the edge of the base of your pot, you should be able to create a small impression on the edge using firm pressure. If you can create a big impression with little effort, your pot is too wet

### How?
There are a number of ways to fix this:
* The simplest and best is to wait
* Stick the pot under a ceiling fan for a period of time (testing it every 10 - 15 minutes)
* This is _not_ recommended but it can work: use a hair dryer on the pot while it's spinning on the wheel.

## __Rule 2:__ The pot should not be too dry

### Details: The pot is too dry if

* It is not cold to the touch (the pot should be colder than the ambient temperature in the space it has been stored)

* You scratch it and create powder or very fine flakes

* The foot cannot be smeared at all

(Sometimes you can only only tell once you start.)

### Why?

There are several reasons why the pot should not be too dry:
* It becomes much more fragile

* When turning, you generate a very fine dust that is easily inhaled.
(That dust is carcinogenic in sufficient doses)

* It rapidly damages the turning tools.
(All turning wears down the tools. When the clay is hard this can happen in a matter of minutes instead of hours. Thus dramatically (and needlessly) reducing the life of the tool.)

### How?

You can reduce the dryness by dunking whole pot in water a couple of times, then dunking only the foot a couple more times. Letting it sit for a couple of minutes between each dunk. Once you've got the pot on the wheel, if you are still (or start) getting fine flakes of clay or dust when you're turning, damp the pot down with a wet sponge (ensuring that no water drips down the pot) every time your turnings become too fine.

## __Rule 3:__ Have your seat adjusted and placed right

### Details:

The further you are away from your pot, the more extended your arms need to be to reach your work, the further away support is from your hands and the harder it is to get control over your hands

### Why?

You want to be comfortable and strong. If your seat is not in the right place, at the right height you will not have the control you need to overcome the possible irregularities in your form. You will also be able to keep your back straighter and be less hunched over which will help with breathing easily.
### Note:

Your seat position for turning is very different to what you need for throwing.

How?

1. Have your seat placed so your elbows can firmly touch your body and your hands can move to the near half of the wheel head.

2. If you've got short legs (like me), and your wheel has a fixed peddle (as most do), rotate your wheel so the peddle is closer to you. You don't want to have your leg too stretched out. Having your Ieg stretched out reduces your leg's ability to provide support for the rest of your body.

3. Adjust your seat so that the top of your seat well below the level with head of the wheel. (The larger the piece of clay the higher your seat should be.)

4. Sit well back on your seat so your body weight is fully supported by your bum and so you can have a straight back.


## __Rule 4:__ Support your hands and arms

### Why?

The further away you are from your pot, the harder it is to provide support for your hands and the harder it is to have control. By sitting as close to the pot as possible you can rest your fore-arms or elbows on your thighs or knees or tuck your elbows into your ribs. I also like to have the other end of the turning tool (the one not on the pot) resting firmly on my chin during the early stages of turning to get added support and control.

### How?

Have your seat as close to the wheel as possible and as low as possible.

### Note:

If you sit all tucked up for too long you can get stiff and cramped. You should get up regularly

## __Rule 5:__ Use the smallest cutting edge possible on irregular surfaces (even on big pots)

### Why?

If you're trying to remove irregularities from the bottom of your pot you need to hold your hands as steady as possible. A small cutting surface has much less resistance to the pot so it is less likely to be pushed around by the pot. This, in turn, makes it much easier to even up the surface

### How?

Choose a tool that either has a small blade (these are usually the older tools) or one that has a very tight curve or square corner.

## __Rule 6:__ Centre the pot relative to the foot.

### Why?

Your pot may not be perfectly centred all over. If you centre your pot relative to its rim or belly, you may find your foot is off centre. This makes it much harder to turn.

## __Rule 7:__ Have the wheel rotating fast

### Why?

If your wheel is rotating fast, the mass of your hands and arms makes it harder for the pot to push you around. Thus it is easier for you to clean up any irregularities. You don't need to apply as much pressure to cut the same amount of clay off the pot and it reduces the likely hood having a catastrophic failure due to excess pressure in one spot.

If your wheel is rotating slowly and the pot's surface is uneven (as is normally the case), you are less able to hold your hands steady to remove the irregularities.


## __Rule 8:__ Move the turning tool slowly

### Why?

If the tool is moving slowly you're less likely to get ring (or rather spiral) marks in your pot.

## __Hot tip:__ Start with the centre of the foot

__NOTE:__ This is mostly for pragmatic reasons

### Why?

Doing the centre of the foot is the bit that you're most likely to stuff up. You have to clean the centre of the foot some time, so you may as well cut your losses and do the risky bit first. If you do stuff it, you haven't invested all that time and energy making the rest of your pot look fantastic. So it's less traumatic. If everything goes smoothly (which should be most of the time) you haven't lost anything.

The other thing is that knowing how much clay you've trimmed off the bottom of your pot helps you judge how much you have to take off the sides.


## __Rule 9:__ Make the outside shape match the inside shape

### Details:

When you're throwing your pot you have a lot of control over the top 2/3 to 3/4 of the pot, but very little control over the bottom 1/3 to 1/4. The best you can do is make the inside look good. Turning is our chance to make the outside shape match the inside, thus giving our pots an even balance.

### Why?

(Theoretically) the upper part of the walls of your pot are an even thickness all the way up. Making the lower part of the pot the same thickness as the rest of the pot allows for even drying. It also helps for even distribution of glaze when it is applied. (More glaze will be absorbed where the clay is thicker.)

It also gives the pot a much more balanced weight making it nicer to hold.

## __Rule 10:__ Clean up the rim when finished

### Why?

Because the rim is in contact with the wheel head during turning it can get slightly damaged. (Or at least look less pristine than it should.)

### How?

Using a moderately wet sponge wipe around the rim in a rolling, spiral motion, moving from inside to outside as you go around.
