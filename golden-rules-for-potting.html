								<h4 class="before"><span>Have your seat adjusted and placed right</span></h4>

								<p>
									<span class="pre">Details:</span>
									<span class="post">The further you are away from your pot, the more extended your arms need to be to reach your work.
									The further away support is from your hands and the harder it is to get control over your hands.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span class="pre">Why?</span>
									<span class="post">You need to be comfortable and strong.
									If your seat is not in the right place, you will not be able to apply the force you need to the clay during the centring process.
									It will also prevent you from having the support you need to use your hands with finesse throughout the rest of the throwing process.</span>
								</p>
								<div>
									<span class="pre">How?</span>
									<div class="post">
									<ol>
										<li>
											Have your seat placed so your elbows can firmly touch your body and your hands can move over the centre of the wheel.</li>
										<li>
											If you've got short legs (like me), and your wheel has a fixed peddle (as most do), rotate your wheel so the peddle is closer to you.
											You don't want to have your leg too stretched out.
											Having your Ieg stretched out reduces your leg's ability to provide support for the rest of your body.
										</li>
										<li>
											Adjust your seat so that the top of your seat roughly level with head of the wheel.
											(The larger the piece of clay the higher your seat should be.)
										</li>
										<li>
											If possible, have your seat tilting forward a little.
										</li>
										<li>
											Perch on your seat.
											If you sit back in your seat your body weight is supported by your bum.
											If you perch on your seat, your legs need to ballance you.
											As you lean forward to put your hands on your pot (if you have your arms supported), your arms start taking the weight of your upper body.
											This makes your arms less mobile and thus less susceptible to moving freely when they shouldn't

								<h4 class="before"><span class="post">Only touch the pot when it's moving</span></h4>

								<p>
									<span class="pre">Why?</span>
									<span class="post">If you touch the pot when it's stopped you distort it in one spot.
									Whereas if you touch it when it's moving the distortion is spread over a much larger area making it much less obvious and making it look intentional.</span>

								<h4 class="before"><span class="post">Always keep both hands connected</span></h4>

								<p>
									<span class="pre">Why?</span>
									<span class="post">When you are learning, your biggest issue is control over how your hands interact with the pot.
									If your hands are connected you don't have think about whether they are moving in the same way/complimentary way.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span class="pre">How?</span>
									<span class="post">
										<strong>When centring:</strong>
										Mostly, I keep my hands so that the base of my thumbs are touching.<br />
										<strong>When pulling up:</strong>
										I generally keep the pad or tip of the thumb of the hand I have inside the pot connected to the back of the thumb on the outside of the pot.<br />
									</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span class="pre">Note:</span>
									<span class="post">There are many different ways you can have your hands touching.

								<div>
									<span class="pre">Why?</span>
									<span class="post">If your base is clean and round, everything else is easy!
									Also having a slight under-cut at the very base of your pot allows your fingers to be in a better position for pulling up.</span>
								</div>
								<div>
									<span class="pre">How?</span>
									<span class="post">Scrape away the uneven clay using index finger or your dominant hand, tightly supported by your other hand.
									<strong>or</strong>, alternatively you could use a wooden (<strong>not</strong> metal) tool, held in one hand and tightly supported by the other hand.
									However, tools tend to take more clay away than using your finger.</span>

								<h4 class="before"><span class="post">Always keep your hands and the pot slippery</span></h4>

								<div>
									<span class="pre">Why?</span>
									<span class="post">If your pot is not slippery, it is sticky.
									This stickiness will cause stress on the walls of your pot and tend to cause unwanted/excessive twisting in the clay.
									This twisting invariably causes the pot to collapse.</span>
								</div>
								<div>
									<span class="pre">How?</span>
									<div class="post">
										<p>
											Each time you take your hand off the pot:
										</p>
										<ol>
											<li>
												Dunk your sponge in your water
											</li>
											<li>
												Make the wheel move moderately slowly
											</li>
											<li>
												Hold your hand (unmoving) over the gently rotating rim of the pot (or the top of your mound of clay, if you haven't opened up yet)
											</li>
											<li>
												As the pot/mound moves below your hand, gently squeeze the water out of the sponge so it runs down your hand and off the knuckle of your little finger onto the rim of the pot
											</li>
											<li>
												Gently adjust the position of your hand so water runs onto the pot flowing down both the inside and outside

									<span class="post">Your hands and especially your fingers are not particularly strong.
									(This is especially true when first learning to throw.)
									By using your body in the following ways, you add significantly to the force you can apply to a lumpy blob of clay

									<div class="post">
										<h5>For people who are taller than 157cm (5ft 4in):</h5>

										<ol>
											<li>
												Tuck your left elbow into your hip so that it is resting.
											</li>
											<li>
												As you need more force, lean on your left arm.
												(This has the benefit of adding your body weight to the force you can apply to the clay.)
											</li>
										</ol>

										<h5>For people who are shorter than 157cm (5ft 4in):</h5>

										<ol>
											<li>
												If your arms aren't long enough, put your left foot on something (like a brick or two) to raise your thigh.
											</li>
											<li>
												Tuck your left elbow into your inner thigh.
											</li>
											<li>
												As you need more force, use your leg to provide extra the muscle.
												(This gives the same effect as leaning on your arm although it lacks the benefits of using body mass).
											</li>
										</ol>

										<h5>For everybody:</h5>

										<ol>
											<li>
												Try and place your left palm at a right angle to your forearm.
											</li>
											<li>
												Apply the force from your body, through your forearm and out (in a straight line) through the heal of your palm.
												<br /> Only apply force using the heal of your palm.
												(Don't use your fingers or even the top of your palm as the flexibility in your hand allows the clay to push your hand about rather than the other way around.)
											</li>
											<li>
												Always use your other hand to apply downwards pressure to stop yourself from pushing the clay off the wheel.
											</li>
											<li>
												Alternate between sideways pressure and downwards pressure to work your clay

								<h4 class="before"><span class="post">Never let any water sit in the bottom of your pot</span></h4>

								<p>
									<span class="pre">Why?</span>
									<span class="post">Clay absorbs water.
									When the water sits in the bottom of your pot, more water is absorbed there than anywhere else.
									As the clay dries out it shrinks.
									The bit that has the most water dries last but it still needs to shrink, even if the rest of the pot has shrunk as much as it can.
									This final shrink in the bottom will cause a crack.<br />
									(This type of crack is called an "S" crack because it forms an "S" shape across the centre of the bottom of your pot.)</span>
									</p>
								<p>
									<span class="pre">How?</span>

								<h4 class="before"><span class="post">Always pull up on the side that's moving away from you</span></h4>

								<p>
									<span class="pre">Why?</span>
									<span>If your clay gets sticky, it can cause your fingers to catch on the walls of your pot.
									If you pull up on the side coming towards you and your fingers stick, they will be forced into the wall of your pot.
									Usually this means the very sudden demise of your pot.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span class="pre">How?</span>
									<span>If your wheel is rotating counter-clock-wise (normal for western wheels/potters), work on the right hand side of the pot.<br />

									<ol>
										<li>
											Make sure the pot and your fingers are nice and slippery.

											Place your thumb and forefinger on the pot so one is inside and the outside (on the side of the pot travelling away from you).
										</li>
										<li>
											Ensure the top of your thumb is just below the lowest point on the rim
										</li>
										<li>
											In the other hand, hold the needle tool so that it can slide across your thumb and into the pot.
										</li>
										<li>
											Ensure the needle tool is resting firmly on your thumb.
											(The pressure helps stabilise your movements and limit the possibility of losing control of the needle tool.)
										</li>
										<li>
											Slowly and gently ide the needle tool towards your forefinger, through the wall of your pot over a number of revolutions of the wheel/pot.
										</li>
										<li>
											Hopefully the ring of excess clay you've just cut off will lift up with the needle tool.
											If not, just stop the wheel and pick off the excess clay with the needle tool.

								<h4 class="before"><span class="post">Flip your pot over as soon as you can</span></h4>
								<p>
									<span class="pre">Why?</span>
									<span>The bulk of moisture in your pot is in the base.
									It is also the area that has the poorest air circulation.
									By placing the pot bottom up you greatly increase the area from which the moisture can evaporate.
									Also the moisture in your pot tends to follow the force of gravity.
									By making the moisture head towards the rim of your pot, you move it to an area of larger surface area by weight, thus making your pot dry more evenly.</span>
								</p>
								<div>
									<span class="pre">How?</span>
									<div>
										As soon as your pot is <em>dry enough</em>, flip it over!
										<br />
										(By "<em>dry enough</em>" I mean that when you touch the rim it moves a little bit but not too freely. And it's not sticky. This state is called "leather hard".
										<br /> If it's a larger pot:
										<ol>
											<li>
												Put a bat on top (the bat must be big enough to cover the entire rim of the pot)
											</li>
											<li>(If it's not already sitting on a bat) place the bottom on another bat</li>
											<li>
												Hold your hands so one hand is supporting the bottom bat from below and the other hand is gently but firmly pressing down on the top bat.
											</li>
											<li>
												Flip the pot over.
											</li>
											<li>
												Remove the bat that is now on the top.

									<span>When you are ready to turn your pot, it needs to be leather hard (or a little harder), not bone dry.
									If it's bone dry when you go to turn it, it will create very fine dust which is a major health hazard to you (and those around you).
									It also makes the tools get very blunt very quickly. Thus greatly reducing the tool's immediate function and overall life span.</span>

				<h2><span>Golden rules for turning</span></h2>
				<div class="question" id="why-turn">
					<h3><span class="post">Why do we turn?</span></h3>
					<p>
						There are three main reasons why we turn our pots:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							To work the pot in a way that we can't when throwing.
						</li>
						<li>
							To make the pot look better/finished/professional.
						</li>
						<li>
							To reduce the overall weight.

								<div>
									<span class="pre">Details</span>
									<div class="post">
										<p><strong>The pot is too wet if:</strong></p>

										<ul>
											<li>
												You can deform the rim by gentle touching
											</li>
											<li>
												You get clay on your fingers when you touch it
											</li>
											<li>
												The foot can easily be <a href="#smeared" class="hidden" title="see Note below for definition of 'smeared'">smeared</a>
											</li>
										</ul>
										<p>
											(Sometimes you can only only tell once you start turning.)
										</p>
									</div>
								</div>
								<div>
									<span class="pre">Why?</span>
									<span>If the pot is too wet when you go to turn it will distort either in the centring process or under the pressure of the turning tools.
									Fortunately, this can sometimes be repaired as you can later distort the pot back to its original shape.</span>
								</div>
								<div id="smeared">
									<span class="pre">Note:</span>
									<span>By <strong>smeared</strong>, I mean if you put your finger to the edge of the base of your pot, you should be able to create a small impression on the edge using firm pressure.
									If you can create a big impression with little effort, your pot is too wet.</span>
								</div>
								<div>
									<span class="pre">How?</span>

									<div class="post">
										<p>There are a number of ways to fix this:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>
												The simplest and best is to wait
											</li>
											<li>
												Stick the pot under a ceiling fan for a period of time (testing it every 10 - 15 minutes)
											</li>
											<li>
												<em>This is not recommended but it can work:</em> Use a hair dryer or heat gun on the pot while it's spinning on the wheel.

									<div class="post">
										<p><strong>The pot is too dry if:</strong></p>

										<ul>
											<li>
												It is not cold to the touch (the pot should be colder than the ambient temperature in the space it has been stored)
											</li>
											<li>
												You scratch it and create powder or very fine flakes
											</li>
											<li>
												The foot cannot be <a href="#smeared" class="hidden" title="see 'The pot should not be too wet'  Note above for definition">smeared</a> at all

										<p class="screen-only">
											(Sometimes you can only only tell once you start.)
										</p>
									</div>
								</div>
								<div>
									<span class="pre">Why?</span>

									<div class="post">
										There are several reasons why the pot should not be too dry:
										<ul>
											<li>
												It becomes much more fragile
											</li>
											<li> When turning, you generate a very fine dust that is easily inhaled.
												<br /> (That dust is carcinogenic in sufficient doses) </li>
											<li> It rapidly damages the turning tools.<br />
												(All turning wears down the tools.
												When the clay is hard this can happen in a matter of minutes instead of hours.
												Thus dramatically (and needlessly) reducing the life of the tool.)
											</li>
										</ul>
									</div>
								</div>
								<p>
									<span class="pre">How?</span>

									<span class="post">
									You can reduce the dryness by dunking whole pot in water a couple of times, then dunking only the foot a couple more times.
									Letting it sit for a couple of minutes between each dunk.
									Once you've got the pot on the wheel, if you are still (or start) getting fine flakes of clay or dust when you're turning, damp the pot down with a wet sponge (ensuring that no water drips down the pot) every time your turnings become too fine.</span>

											If you've got short legs (like me), and your wheel has a fixed peddle (as most do), rotate your wheel so the peddle is closer to you.
											You don't want to have your leg too stretched out. Having your Ieg stretched out reduces your leg's ability to provide support for the rest of your body.
										</li>
										<li>
											Adjust your seat so that the top of your seat well below the level with head of the wheel.
											(The larger the piece of clay the higher your seat should be.)
										</li>
										<li>
											Sit well back on your seat so your body weight is fully supported by your bum and so you can have a straight back.

								<h3 class="before"><span class="post">Support your hands and arms</span></h3>

								<p>
									<span class="pre">Why?</span>

									<span class="post">
									The further away you are from your pot, the harder it is to provide support for your hands and the harder it is to have control.
									By sitting as close to the pot as possible you can rest your fore-arms or elbows on your thighs or knees or tuck your elbows into your ribs.
									I also like to have the other end of the turning tool (the one not on the pot) resting firmly on my chin during the early stages of turning to get added support and control.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span class="pre">How?</span>

									<span class="post">
									Have your seat as close to the wheel as possible and as low as possible.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span class="pre">Note:</span>

									<span class="post">
									If you sit all tucked up for too long you can get stiff and cramped.
									You should get up regularly</span>

							<article class="rule">
								<h3 class="before"><span class="post">Use the smallest cutting edge possible on irregular surfaces (even on big pots)</span></h3>

								<p>
									<span class="pre">Why?</span>

									<span class="post">
									If you're trying to remove irregularities from the bottom of your pot you need to hold your hands as steady as possible.
									A small cutting surface has much less resistance to the pot so it is less likely to be pushed around by the pot.
									This, in turn, makes it much easier to even up the surface</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span class="pre">How?</span>

									<span class="post">
									Choose a tool that either has a small blade (these are usually the older tools) or one that has a very tight curve or square corner.</span>

						<li id="centred">
							<article class="rule">
								<h3 class="before"><span class="post">Centre the pot relative to the foot.</span></h3>

								<p>
									<span class="pre">Why?</span>

									<span class="post">
									Your pot may not be perfectly centred all over.
									If you centre your pot relative to its rim or belly, you may find your foot is off centre. This makes it much harder to turn.</span>

						</li>
						<li id="fast">
							<article class="rule">
								<h3 class="before"><span class="post">Have the wheel rotating fast</span></h3>

								<p>
									<span class="pre">Why?</span>

									<span class="post">
									If your wheel is rotating fast, the mass of your hands and arms makes it harder for the pot to push you around.
									Thus it is easier for you to clean up any irregularities.
									You don't need to apply as much pressure to cut the same amount of clay off the pot and it reduces the likely hood having a catastrophic failure due to excess pressure in one spot.<br />
									If your wheel is rotating slowly and the pot's surface is uneven (as is normally the case), you are less able to hold your hands steady to remove the irregularities.</span>

							<article class="rule">
								<h3 class="before"><span class="post">Move the turning tool slowly</span></h3>
								<p>
									<span class="pre">Why?</span>

									<span class="post">
									If the tool is moving slowly you're less likely to get ring (or rather spiral) marks in your pot.</span>

								<h3 class="before"><span class="post">Start with the centre of the foot</span></h3>
								<p>
									<span class="pre">Details:</span>

									<span class="post">This is mostly for pragmatic reasons</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span class="pre">Why?</span>

									<span class="post">
									Doing the centre of the foot is the bit that you're most likely to stuff up.
									You have to clean the centre of the foot some time, so you may as well cut your losses and do the risky bit first.
									If you do stuff it, you haven't invested all that time and energy making the rest of your pot look fantastic.
									So it's less traumatic.
									If everything goes smoothly (which should be most of the time) you haven't lost anything.<br />
									The other thing is that knowing how much clay you've trimmed off the bottom of your pot helps you judge how much you have to take off the sides.</span>

							<article class="rule">
								<h3 class="before"><span class="post">Make the outside shape match the inside shape</span></h3>
								<p>
									<span class="pre">Details:</span>

									<span class="post">
									When you're throwing your pot you have a lot of control over the top 2/3 to 3/4 of the pot, but very little control over the bottom 1/3 to 1/4.
									The best you can do is make the inside look good. Turning is our chance to make the outside shape match the inside, thus giving our pots an even balance.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span class="pre">Why?</span>

									<span class="post">
									(Theoretically) the upper part of the walls of your pot are an even thickness all the way up.
									Making the lower part of the pot the same thickness as the rest of the pot allows for even drying.
									It also helps for even distribution of glaze when it is applied. (More glaze will be absorbed where the clay is thicker.)<br />
									It also gives the pot a much more balanced weight making it nicer to hold.

								<h3 class="before"><span class="post">Clean up the rim when finished</span></h3>
								<p>
									<span class="pre">Why?</span>

									<span class="post">
									Because the rim is in contact with the wheel head during turning it can get slightly damaged.
									(Or at least look less pristine than it should.)</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span class="pre">Why?</span>

									<span class="post">
									Using a moderately wet sponge wipe around the rim in a rolling, spiral motion, moving from inside to outside as you go around.</span>
