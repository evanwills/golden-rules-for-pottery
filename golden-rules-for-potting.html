							<div class="why">You want to be comfortable and strong. If your seat is not in the right place, at the right height and tilted forward a little, you will not be able to apply the force you need to the clay during the centering process. Or have the support you need to use your hands with finesse throughout the rest of the thowing process.</div>
							<div class="how">
								<ol>
									<li>Have your seat placed so your elbows can firmly touch your body and your hands can move over the centre of the wheel.</li>
									<li>If you've got short legs (like me), and your wheel has a fixed peddle (as most do), rotate your wheel so the peddle is closer to you. You don't want to have your leg too stretched out. Having your Ieg stretched out reduces your leg's ability to provide support for the rest of your body.</li>
									<li>Adjust your seat so that the top of your seat roughly level with head of the wheel. (The larger the piece of clay the higher your seat should be.)</li>
									<li>Perch on your seat. If you sit back in your seat your body weight is supported by your bum. If you perch on your seat, your legs need to ballance you. As you lean forward to put your hands on your pot (if you have your arms supported) your arms start taking the weight of your upper body providing making your arms less mobile and thus less susceptible to moving freely when they shouldn't</li>

								<strong>When centering:</strong> Mostly, I keep my hands so that the base of my thumbs are touching.<br />
								<strong>When pulling up:</strong>I generally keep the pad or tip of the thumb of the hand I have inside the pot (my left when the wheel is moving counter-clockwise) connected to the back of the thumb on the outside of the pot.

							<h1>Use your body to give you extra power</h1>
							<div class="details">Your hands and especially your fingers are not particularly strong. (This is especially true when first learning to throw.) By using your body in the following ways, you add significantly to the force you can apply to a lumpy blob of clay (or a large fat doughnut of clay you want to bring up into a cylinder).</div>
							<div class="note"> (The following applies to wheels that move counter clock-wise (western/European wheels). If your wheel rotates clock-wise (Asian wheels), just swap the hands/feet assigned.)</div>

								<h2>For people who are taller than 157cm (5ft 4in):</h2>
								<ol>
									<li>Tuck your left elbow into your hip so that it is resting.</li>
									<li>As you need more force, lean on your left arm. (This has the benefit of adding your body weight to the force you can apply to the clay.)</li>
								</ol>
								<h2>For people who are shorter than 157cm (5ft 4in):</h2>
								<ol>
									<li>If your arms aren't long enough, put your left foot on something (like a brick or two) to raise your thigh.</li>
									<li>Tuck your left elbow into your inner thigh.</li>
									<li>As you need more force, use your leg to provide extra the muscle (this gives the same effect as leaning on your arm although it lacks the benefits of using body mass).</li>
								</ol>
								<h2 class="page-br">For everybody:</h2>
								<ol>
									<li>Try and place your left palm at a right angle to your forearm.</li>
									<li> Apply the force from your body, through your forearm and out (in a straight line) through the heal of your palm.
										<br /> Only apply force using the heal of your palm. (Don't use your fingers or even the top of your palm as the flexibility in your hand allows the clay to push your hand about rather than the other way around.) </li>
									<li>Always use your other hand to apply downwards pressure to stop yourself from pushing the clay off the wheel.</li>
									<li>Alternate between sideways pressure and downwards pressure to work your clay</li>

							<div class="why"> Clay absorbs water. When the water sits in the bottom of your pot, more water is absorbed there than anywhere else. As the clay dries out it shrinks. The bit that has the most water dries last but it still needs to shrink, even if the rest of the pot has shrunk as much as it can. This final shrink in the bottom will cause a crack.

							<div class="why">The bulk of moisture in your pot is in the base. It is also the area that has the poorest air circulation. By placing the pot bottom up you greatly increase the area from which the moisture can evaporate. Also the moisture in your pot tends to follow the force of gravity. By making the moisture head towards the rim of your pot, you move it to an area of larger surface area by weight, thus making your pot dry more evenly.</div>
							<div class="how"> As soon as your pot is <em>dry enough</em>, flip it over!
								<br /> (By "<em>dry enough</em>" I mean that when you touch the rim it moves a little bit but not too freely. And it's not sticky. This state is called "leather hard".
								<br /> If it's a larger pot:
								<ol>
									<li>Put a bat on top (the bat must be big enough to cover the entire rim of the pot)</li>
									<li>(If it's not already sitting on a bat) place the bottom on another bat</li>
									<li>Hold your hands so one hand is supporting the bottom bat from below and the other hand is gently but firmly pressing down on the top bat.</li>

								<h1>Wrap your pot if you're not going to work on it for a couple of days</h1>

							<div class="why">When you are ready to turn your pot, it needs to be leather hard (or a little harder), not bone dry. If it's bone dry when you go to turn it, it will create very fine dust which is a major health hazard to you (and those around you). It also makes the tools get very blunt very quickly. Thus greatly reducing the tool's immediate function and overall life span.</div>

			<h1>Golden rules for turning</h1>
			<div class="question">
				<h2>Why do we turn?</h2>
				<p>There are three main reasons why we turn our pots:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>To work the pot in a way that we can't when throwing.</li>
					<li>To make the pot look better/finished/professional.</li>
					<li>To reduce the overall weight.</li>
				</ol>
			</div>

				<ol>
					<li id="not-wet">
						<article class="rule no1">
							<header>
								<h1>The pot should not be too wet</h1>
							</header>
							<div class="details">
								<h2>The pot is too wet if:</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>You can deform the rim by gentle touching</li>
									<li>You get clay on your fingers when you touch it</li>
									<li>The foot can easily be <a href="#smeared" class="hidden" title="see Note below for definition of 'smeared'">smeared</a></li>
								</ul>
								<p>(Sometimes you can only only tell once you start turning.)</p>
							</div>
							<div class="why">If the pot is too wet when you go to turn it will distort either in the centering process or under the pressure of the turning tools. Fortunately, this can sometimes be repaired as you can later distort the pot back to its original shape.</div>
							<div class="note" id="smeared">By <strong>smeared</strong>, I mean if you put your finger to the edge of the base of your pot, you should be able to create a small impression on the edge using firm pressure. If you can create a big impression with little effort, your pot is too wet</div>
							<div class="how">There are a number of ways to fix this:
								<ul>
									<li>The simplest and best is to wait</li>
									<li>Stick the pot under a ceiling fan for a period of time (testing it every 10 - 15 minutes)</li>
									<li>This is not recommended but it can work: use a hair dryer on the pot while it's spinning on the wheel.</li>
								</ul>

							<header>
								<h1>The pot should not be too dry</h1>
							</header>
							<div class="details">
								<h2>The pot is too dry if</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>It is not cold to the touch (the pot should be colder than the ambient temperature in the space it has been stored)</li>
									<li>You scratch it and create powder or very fine flakes</li>
									<li>The foot cannot be <a href="#smeared" class="hidden" title="see Note above for definition of 'smeared'">smeared</a> at all</li>
								</ul>
								<p>(Sometimes you can only only tell once you start.)</p>
							</div>
							<div class="why">There are several reasons why the pot should not be too dry:
								<ul>
									<li>It becomes much more fragile</li>
									<li> When turning, you generate a very fine dust that is easily inhaled.
										<br /> (That dust is carcinogenic in sufficient doses) </li>
									<li> It rapidly damages the turning tools.
										<br /> (All turning wears down the tools. When the clay is hard this can happen in a matter of minutes instead of hours. Thus dramatically (and needlessly) reducing the life of the tool.) </li>
								</ul>
							</div>
							<div class="how">You can reduce the dryness by dunking whole pot in water a couple of times, then dunking only the foot a couple more times. Letting it sit for a couple of minutes between each dunk. Once you've got the pot on the wheel, if you are still (or start) getting fine flakes of clay or dust when you're turning, damp the pot down with a wet sponge (ensuring that no water drips down the pot) every time your turnings become too fine.</div>

If your seat is not in the right place, at the right height you will not have the control you need to overcome the possible irregularities in your form.

									<li>If you've got short legs (like me), and your wheel has a fixed peddle (as most do), rotate your wheel so the peddle is closer to you. You don't want to have your leg too stretched out. Having your Ieg stretched out reduces your leg's ability to provide support for the rest of your body.</li>
									<li>Adjust your seat so that the top of your seat well below the level with head of the wheel. (The larger the piece of clay the higher your seat should be.)</li>
									<li>Sit well back on your seat so your body weight is fully supported by your bum and so you can have a straight back.</li>

								<h1>Support your hands and arms</h1>

							<div class="why">The further away you are from your pot, the harder it is to provide support for your hands and the harder it is to have control. By sitting as close to the pot as possible you can rest your fore-arms or elbows on your thighs or knees or tuck your elbows into your ribs. I also like to have the other end of the turning tool (the one not on the pot) resting firmly on my chin during the early stages of turning to get added support and control.</div>
							<div class="how">Have your seat as close to the wheel as possible and as low as possible.</div>

								<h1>Use the smallest cutting edge possible on irregular surfaces (even on big pots)</h1>
							</header>
							<div class="why">If you're trying to remove irregularities from the bottom of your pot you need to hold your hands as steady as possible. A small cutting surface has much less resistance to the pot so it is less likely to be pushed around by the pot. This, in turn, makes it much easier to even up the surface</div>

								<h1>Centre the pot relative to the foot.</h1>
							</header>
							<div class="why">Your pot may not be perfectly centred all over. If you centre your pot relative to its rim or belly, you may find your foot is off centre. This makes it much harder to turn.</div>

								<h1>Have the wheel rotating fast</h1>
							</header>
							<div class="why"> If your wheel is rotating fast, the mass of your hands and arms makes it harder for the pot to push you around. Thus it is easier for you to clean up any irregularities. You don't need to apply as much pressure to cut the same amount of clay off the pot and it reduces the likely hood having a catastrophic failure due to excess pressure in one spot.
								<br /> If your wheel is rotating slowly and the pot's surface is uneven (as is normally the case), you are less able to hold your hands steady to remove the irregularities. </div>

								<h1>Start with the centre of the foot</h1>
							</header>
							<div class="details">This is mostly for pragmatic reasons</div>
							<div class="why">
								Doing the centre of the foot is the bit that you're most likely to stuff up.
								You have to clean the centre of the foot some time, so you may as well cut your losses and do the risky bit first.
								If you do stuff it, you haven't invested all that time and energy making the rest of your pot look fantastic. So it's less traumatic.
								If everything goes smoothly (which should be most of the time) you haven't lost anything.<br />
								The other thing is that knowing how much clay you've trimmed off the bottom of your pot helps you judge how much you have to take off the sides.

								<h1>Make the outside shape match the inside shape</h1>
							</header>
							<div class="details">When you're throwing your pot you have a lot of control over the top 2/3 to 3/4 of the pot, but very little control over the bottom 1/3 to 1/4. The best you can do is make the inside look good. Turning is our chance to make the outside shape match the inside, thus giving our pots an even balance.</div>
							<div class="why">
								(Theoretically) the upper part of the walls of your pot are an even thickness all the way up. Making the lower part of the pot the same thickness as the rest of the pot allows for even drying. It also helps for even distribution of glaze when it is applied. (More glaze will be absorbed where the clay is thicker.)<br />
								It also gives the pot a much more balanced weight making it nicer to hold.
